# 牌组选项

子牌组可以有自己的牌组选项设置。

> If your deck has subdecks, each deck can optionally be assigned a different preset. When Anki shows a card, it will check which subdeck the card is in, and use the options for that deck. 

每天的学习新卡片的数量有牌组选项的设定值控制（默认值20），如果有一天没有学习，第二天学习新卡片的数量仍然是20.

V3

> Controls how many new cards are introduced each day you open the program. If you study fewer than the limit, or miss a day, the next day the counts will be back to your limit - they do not accumulate.
>
> In [the v3 scheduler](https://faqs.ankiweb.net/the-2021-scheduler.html), Anki uses the limits of the deck you select as an upper limit on the number of cards. This means if "French" has a limit of 20 cards and "French::Lesson 1" and "French::Lesson 2" both have limits of 15 cards, when you click on "French", you’ll get at most 15 cards from either child deck, and only 20 cards in total.
