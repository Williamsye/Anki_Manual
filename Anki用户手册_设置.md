设置-计划-提前学习的上限



> **Learn ahead limit**
> Tells Anki how to behave when there is nothing left to study in the current deck but cards in learning. The default setting of 20 minutes tells Anki that cards should be shown early if they have a delay of less than 20 minutes and there’s nothing else to do. If you set this to 0, Anki will always wait the full delay, showing the congratulations screen until the remaining cards are ready to be reviewed.



通常情况下，在当前时间点，复习完所有卡片，会弹出祝贺窗口，学习结束。这个选项设定个数值，比如默认的20分钟，当前的任务量变成是计划的所有卡片+在20分钟内就要复习的卡片。提前复习就是这个意思。如果设定为0，则不管在当前时间点上1分钟后就又会有卡片要复习情况下，直接显示祝贺窗口，学习结束！

> If there’s nothing else to study, Anki will show cards up to 20 minutes early by default. The amount of time to look ahead is configurable in the [preferences](https://docs.ankiweb.net/preferences.html).
